# Recycling-System-Project
This project is a simple Python program for simulating an automated collection and reward system for recyclable items. It allows users to add recyclable items, view total rewards, and reset the system through a command-line interface. Built using Python programming language. This project is a basic prototype and may be expanded in the future.
## Code Structure
The project consists of a single Python script `main.py` and a class `RecyclingSystem` defined within it. The `main()` function provides the command-line interface for user interactions, while the `RecyclingSystem` class encapsulates the functionalities of the recycling system.

## Assumptions and Design Decisions
- Item types are predefined as 'Type A', 'Type B', and 'Type C', with corresponding reward rates.
- The system allows for both integer and floating-point quantities of items.
- Input for item type is case-insensitive to enhance user experience.
